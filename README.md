Analysis of AI adoption among developers using Stack Overflow 2025 survey

# How Developer Features Influence AI Tool Adoption

## Project Overview
This project uses the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to explore which developer characteristics predict AI tool adoption. I perform exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and train a Random Forest model.

## Files
- `AI_Developer_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing full analysis
- `README.md`: This file

## Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Key Insights
1. Higher education correlates with higher AI adoption
2. Larger organizations have higher AI adoption
3. Mid- to late-career developers adopt AI more than novices
4. Random Forest model predicts AI adoption with ~94% accuracy

## Instructions
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode
2. Execute all cells in order to reproduce results
